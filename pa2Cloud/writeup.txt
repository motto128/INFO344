Web service works – API returns query suggestions in JSON (fast!)
Client-side AJAX & modify DOM to show retrieved query suggestions
Web service written in C# – C# best practices!
Query suggestion web service runs on Azure

This started with downloading the wiki data then wrote a console app
to remove any unwanted data, such as titles with any special characters.
I uploaded the cleaned wiki data to my created blob using azure cloud 
storage. I created a web servie project containing three main parts being
the ASMX file and the C# trie class and the node class. I implimented 3 main 
web methods in the AMSX file, downloadWiki, buildTrie, and searchTrie. All
methods held return values for checking and error handling. The downloadWiki
method gets the wiki data on my cloud storage account and downloads the file
to a temp path on the compute and returns an indication is it was successful.
The buildTrie method takes that path the wiki file was downloaded to and iterates
each line in the data and passes it to a sub method in my Trie class. It also 
checks to see the memory proccess of the system or service being used to stop
the building of the trie structure if excceds the given limit. The serperate 
Trie class then calls AddTitle method loops through the given line to add 
characters into appropriate dictionaries and sets the last character of the 
leaf node to true. The searchTrie web method takes in an input from the index.html
and trims and lowercases the given string and passes it to a sub method 
SearchForPrefix in the Trie class to search if any words match. This will pass
into helper method in the Trie class, GetWord to help traverse the trie structure
in a recursive way returning an list. It will return a list containing up to 10 strings
to the searchTrie method so it can convert the return string to a JSON format.
I also added a javascript file to see when the when the user types or changes thier
input in the search bar and sending an ajax request to the searchTrie method and 
proccessing the returned value. After the request was successfull the it sends the
stringifyed data to the helper method called display and formats the data recieved
into the perfered html format and appends it to the results section to display on
the webpage. If no search query was found it will append 'no suggestions found' for
an instantaneous feedback displayed to the user. Also for each keyup or changes to
the search bar before the AJAX request it will delete any results that were previously
appended and update the new results to append.
